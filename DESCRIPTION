Author: André Bourbonnais, Luan Gardenalli
Maintainer: André Bourbonnais <andbou95@gmail.com>
Description: Package with enrichment analysis tools for bulk RNA-seq data. 
    With quality processed RNA-seq data, one can use LuAndre to filter 
    biological unrelevant gene counts and conduct an differential analysis by 
    fitting a general linear model. Either with a wrapper or step-wise workflow.
    In the end, a summarised excel file and multiple enrichment plots will be
    stored in your working directory.
